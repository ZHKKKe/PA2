# PA2
PA2 for Machine Learning Course


**Requirement**

Just run code under develop environment, no more test for other envs. 
  - Ubuntu 16.04
  - Anaconda3 + Python3.5
  - Python package: 
      - numpy: for saving matrix
      - scipy: for load .mat file
      - matplotlib: draw curves
      - sklearn: for EM-GMM algorithm


**Structure of Project**
  - src: main source code. (algorithm, drawer and dataloader)
  - third_party: code from canvas
  - data: readable format of data
 
 
**Step to Run**
  - for Part1, run python **src/algorithm.py** after uncomment the algorithm in the file
  - for Part2, run python **third_party/test_pa2.py** after uncomment the algorithm in the file
